# Choice Set

Code & supporting documents related to the design of the choice set (i.e. the monetary options presented to participants)

## Choice set constraints/meta-parameters
- Can do on the order of ~100 stimulations.
- Stimulation is brief (50ms).
- Stimulation trials & non-stimulation trials will be blocked, and blocks will be pseudorandomly intermixed. (_shoot for 4-5 blocks/condition?_)
- 30-45 minutes of active task time
- Normal trial timing is 8s/trial on average.
 - option presentation: 2s
 - response window: 2s
 - ISI: 1s
 - outcome: 1s
 - ITI: 1-3s (mean = 2s)

If the above assumptions hold true[^1], then a reasonably possible total number of trials is **~190-340 total** (95-170/condition; for ~4-5 blocks of each condition, that's ~20 trials/block).

>Previous published studies of ours with similar two-condition designs and similar parameter estimation constraints/goals have used 150 trials/condition to establish different choices on the basis of emotion regulation (S-H et al, 2013), propranolol (S-H et al, 2015), and acute stress (null effect; S-H et al, 2016) and 140 trials/condition for the effects of emotion regulation (S-H et al, 2009).

[^1] Some patients may need a longer response window than the normal 2s window, which will reduce the # of trials they can complete.

## Choice Set Goals

- [ ] Design to be easily re-started if it must be momentarily stopped for any reason.
- [ ] Select choice set trials such that first X (90?) number of trials/condition can function as standalone choice set (any remaining trials are gravy).
- [ ] Aim for a total of 150 trials/condition (_300 trials total, 40 minutes of active task not incl. breaks_).
